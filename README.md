# PacktCoffeeShop

This is the code from my video course with Packt Publishing, you can find it here: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-and-Deploying-Java-EE-Microservices-on-the-Cloud

I want to play a bit more with the microservices, so if you want the original code grab it from the link above.

## Customers
Uses the Payara embedded H2 database and Microprofile 1.3. Can be deployed on a Payara Web or Full server, or on Payara Micro (as intended) with `java -jar <payara-micro>.jar PacktCustomer.war --port 8085`
